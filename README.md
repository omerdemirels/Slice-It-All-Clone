# Slice-It-All-Clone
This is the clone prototype of Slice It All game

This GitHub repository is a clone of the popular mobile game Slice It All. The game challenges players to use a virtual knife to slice various objects into smaller pieces, with the goal of achieving a specific target number of slices for each level.In this clone, i have recreated the core gameplay mechanics of the original game, including the swipe-based slicing controls and the level-based progression system. The graphics have been faithfully recreated, and players can enjoy the same satisfying slicing action that made the original game so popular.
